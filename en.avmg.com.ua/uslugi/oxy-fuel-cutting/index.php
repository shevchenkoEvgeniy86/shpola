<h3>Oxy Fuel Cutting</h3>
<p>
	Oxy fuel cutting is used for the low-carbon steel with the thickness from 20 to 80 mm. Oxy fuel cutting is the process that involves heating of the necessary parts with gas flame of the certain temperature.
	Next the metal ignites and forms oxides, which are subsequently blown with a stream of oxygen.
</p>
<p>
	Oxy fuel cutting has a number of undoubted advantages: it is easily produced, doesn’t require complex equipment and doesn’t need any energy supplies.
	This type of cutting is controlled with the CNC system with a high-speed, powerful drive.
	Therefore, our equipment allows to complete sheet metal cutting of ferrous materials and non-ferrous metals.
