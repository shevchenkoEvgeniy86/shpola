	Using such technology, it is possible to cut structural, stainless and high alloy steels, and all types types of non-ferrous metals.
</p>
<p>
	After using the belt-saw machine, the resulting raw materials don’t require additional treating of the cutting places.
	Due to the lack of thermal impact in the nip point, there are no liquated edge and edge heat hardening.
	As metal cutting on the belt-saw machine doesn’t consume much energy, the cost of such cutting type is relatively low.
